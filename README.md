# Customer_attrition_model

Customers who are likely to churn have been identified with a lead time of two months.
Variables were identified based on the information values and the correlation among them.
We started with a logistic regression but also tried non linear models like decision tree classifier, Random Forest and XGBoost.
Based on the results(ROC, false positives and false negatives) we recommended the random forest model.
